## A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.
We will use the FastF1 Python Library which provides comprehensive access to Formula 1 data through two integrated sources that together enable long-term statistical analysis and detailed modern performance modeling:
1. Historical Data (via Ergast API):
- Coverage: 1996-2024 (29 seasons)
- Variables: Race results, qualifying positions, driver standings, constructor standings, circuit information
- Key features: Position, Grid Position, Points, Laps Completed, Status (Finished/DNF), Fastest Lap

2. Modern Telemetry & Timing Data (via F1 Live Timing API):
- Coverage: 2018-2024 (7 seasons with full telemetry)
- Variables: Lap-by-lap timing, sector times, tire compounds, speed traps, weather conditions
- Key features: Sector times, lap time consistency, tire strategy, track temperature

Dataset Dimensions:
- Races: ~147 Grand Prix events (21 races/season × 7 seasons)
- Observations: ~2,940 driver-race combinations (20 drivers × 147 races)


### Why This Dataset?
FastF1 provides official F1 timing data with high accuracy, maintained by an active developer community. 
Access to both historical results and modern telemetry enables sophisticated feature engineering beyond simple win/loss records.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

Question 1: What factors are most predictive of Formula 1 race winners?

Question 2: Can ensemble methods improve race winner prediction accuracy beyond individual models, and which ensemble strategy performs best for this classification task?


## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
Develop a machine learning classification model to predict Formula 1 race winners by analyzing historical race performance, qualifying results, and driver/constructor trends using ensemble methods. Fo which 
We will compare the performance of individual classification models against ensemble approaches. 
For which we will train multiple candidate models, evaluate their individual performance, and then test whether combining their predictions through ensemble methods (stacking, voting, or boosting) yields better results than any single approach.
