## A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.
Our analysis utilizes the comprehensive Formula 1 World Championship dataset available on Kaggle, originally compiled from the Ergast Developer API. 
This dataset represents historical records of Formula 1 racing spanning from 1950 to 2024. 

Dataset Dimensions:
- Coverage: 74 seasons (1950–2024)
- Total races: ~1,100 Grand Prix events
- Race results: ~25,000 driver-race combinations
- Files: 14 CSV files including results, qualifying, standings, circuits, and lap times

### Why This Dataset?
- Sufficient data for training robust machine learning models. 
- The data has been carefully curated and cleaned by the F1 analytics community, reducing preprocessing overhead and ensuring reliability. 
- The dataset's structure naturally separates pre-race information (qualifying results, standings, circuit data) from race outcomes, which is crucial for building a 
prediction model that avoids data leakage. 
 - The dataset is well-documented and widely used in motorsport analytics research, providing a strong foundation for reproducible research.


### Motivation & Real-World Applications
Understanding which pre-race factors drive Formula 1 success provides actionable insights for multiple stakeholders:
 - For F1 Teams: Predictive models can inform resource allocation between qualifying optimization and race-day strategy. By quantifying the relative importance of grid position, recent form, and team performance, teams can justify investments in qualifying simulations, aerodynamic development, or strategic planning.
 - For Analysts & Broadcasters: Data-driven pre-race predictions enhance viewer engagement through evidence-based commentary. 
 - For Sports Analytics Research: This project demonstrates best practices for temporal modeling in sequential competitions—preventing data leakage in time-series data, balancing model complexity with interpretability, and validating predictions using chronological splits. These techniques transfer to other motorsports and sports with similar temporal structures.

## Questions

Question 1: Which pre-race factors are most predictive of a Formula 1 driver’s race outcome? (e.g., grid position, constructor, driver form, circuit characteristics).  
Question 2: Can regression models accurately predict driver finishing positions using only pre-race data, and which model performs best for this task?
* The focus will be on understanding what influences success rather than perfect prediction accuracy.

## Analysis plan

We will predict a driver’s finishing position (positionOrder) using data available before or at the start of each race.
This will help identify which pre-race factors contribute most strongly to race outcomes.

### Data Preparation
 - Merge relevant CSVs: results, races, drivers, constructors, circuits, and qualifying.
 - Select only pre-race variables to avoid leakage from in-race or post-race data.
 - Apply feature engineering to derive:
    - Average driver points from recent races
    - Team performance trend (constructor standings)
    - Qualifying position and grid advantage
    - Circuit-level attributes (e.g., country, type)
 - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical ones.

### Modeling Approach
We will start with multiple regression models to predict finishing position (positionOrder) for each driver:
 - Linear Regression: baseline for interpretability
 - Random Forest Regressor: capture non-linear interactions
 - XGBoost Regressor: efficient, high-performance gradient boosting method
If results show instability or complementary strengths across models, we may test a simple ensemble (e.g., stacking) to assess improvement, but only if it adds meaningful value.

### Evaluation Metrics
We will evaluate model performance using:
 - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – how far the prediction is from the true position
 - R² Score, i.e., how much variance is explained by the model
We’ll also compare feature importances to identify the most influential predictors (e.g., grid position, constructor, driver consistency).

### Validation
 - Train/test split by season to mimic real-world forecasting
 - 5-fold cross-validation to ensure generalization and reduce overfitting

## Weekly Plan
Weeks 1–2: Loading data, performing exploratory analysis, and engineering features. Merging the 14 CSV files and creating historical rolling averages.  
Weeks 3–4: Training individual models and performing hyperparameter tuning. Establishing baseline performance and identifying the strongest individual model through cross-validation.  
Week 5: Implementing the ensemble model and conducting a comprehensive evaluation.  
Week 6: Performing final analysis, creating one or more visualizations, and preparing the report.
